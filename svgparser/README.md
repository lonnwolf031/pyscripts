Read me please!
=============

What is this?
-------------
This directory contains a python script to parse SVG files.

It uses the BeautifulSoup Python library. 
Install BeautifulSoup with pip:
> pip install beautifulsoup4

Specific purpose
-------------
This script is written for a project in which a .svg file with cards have to be split 
into seperate .svg files. 

I wanted to generalize the script and abstract the specific purpose away but due to circumstances
I couldn't. 

Using this script
